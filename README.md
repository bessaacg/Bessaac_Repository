Current Project:	Student Administration System

This system helps the Admin staff to manage financial aspect of the organisation in the form of fees paid by the students. The system is operational and was developed using C#.Net and SQL. Stored procedures were used in the creation of reports.


How the system operates:
Records all the student details of all the student enrolled at campus level.
Captures transactions (fees paid by a student).
Updates student details if there is any change in student details or if the student details were incorrectly captured.
The system tracks all students registered for a certain qualification per academic year.
Tracks students who are lagging behind in fees payments and also identities those who are paying their instalments well.
Identifies the courses with highest fee collection and those with poor fee collection
